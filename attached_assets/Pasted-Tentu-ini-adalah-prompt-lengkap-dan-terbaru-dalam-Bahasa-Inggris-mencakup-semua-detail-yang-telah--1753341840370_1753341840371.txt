Web Design Prompt - Lander.studio & Lander.studio/works Replication
Create a modern, minimalist, and conversion-focused web design, inspired by Lander.studio and its Lander.studio/works page. Focus on a clean aesthetic, strong typography, effective use of negative space, and subtle interactive elements. The design should fully support Light Mode only.

Development Approach: A Mobile-First approach must be applied throughout the entire design and CSS/Tailwind implementation process.

Design Flexibility: All styling must be implemented using Tailwind CSS. All textual content and image references (paths) must be managed through a content.json file for easy editing.

Section 1: Homepage Design (Lander.studio)
A. Layout & General Structure:
Header:

Minimalist with the logo on the left (Lander with a leaf/stem icon).

Centered Main Navigation:

The main navigation containing "Home" and "Works" must be centrally located on the screen, using a "segmented control" or "toggle-like" design.

Example: An elongated light gray rounded box containing two similarly shaped buttons. The active button (e.g., "Home") is white/bright with dark text, while the inactive button (e.g., "Works") is lighter gray with lighter gray text.

Other navigation links (such as "About" and "Contact") can be placed elsewhere as appropriate (e.g., in the footer, or only appearing in the mobile hamburger menu) to maintain the central focus of the main navigation.

Include a prominent "Book a Call" CTA button or similar on the far right, with a dark background and light text, in a pill shape.

Scroll Behavior (Important!):

The navbar must have a fixed position at the top.

When the user scrolls down, the navbar should smoothly disappear (e.g., slide up and/or fade-out).

When the user scrolls up, the navbar should reappear with a smooth slide-down or fade-in animation.

Responsiveness: A hamburger icon for mobile, which will reveal all navigation links (Home, Works, About, Contact, and the "Book a Call" CTA). Ensure the navbar's layout and functionality are not broken on either mobile or desktop displays.

Hero Section (Significantly updated):

Dominant, clean, and contains most of the initial information.

Wave Texture (Important!):

The background of the Hero Section must feature a subtle, abstract wave texture as seen in the provided reference image.

This texture should have low opacity (around 10-20%) to avoid being too distracting and only add visual depth.

Implementation can use an SVG or PNG background image with background-image and background-repeat, controlling its opacity (possibly via a pseudo-element or an overlay div with bg-opacity in Tailwind).

Main Heading: Large and impactful, using Instrument Serif 400 (e.g., "We Deliver Standout Websites with Effortless Collaboration").

Supporting Sub-heading/Statistics: Small text below the main heading (e.g., "70+ Amazing Websites Created So Far"), using Montserrat or Poppins.

Primary CTA Button: A clear and prominent CTA button, similar to the one in the header, perhaps with text like "Book a Call" or "Start Your Project".

Small Text Below CTA: (e.g., "Accepting new projects") with a small checkmark icon, using Montserrat or Poppins.

Project Showcase (Integral to Hero Section):

Display project snippets in a horizontally scrollable carousel layout (not a static grid). This carousel must be placed directly below the Hero's text and CTA button area.

Dynamic Project Effects: Each project item (thumbnail/project card) should have an engaging hover effect or animation transition. On hover, change the project image or display an overlay with the project title and category. Transitions must be smooth and modern.

The carousel should have minimalist arrow navigation or indicators on the sides (optional, if needed for user control).

Carousel Transitions/Animations: Ensure scrolling between projects in the carousel is smooth and visually appealing.

Project Images: Images should clearly represent the website/project (like a laptop/desktop mockup), ideally with a subtle shadow or elevation effect.

"Tools Used" / Partner Logos Section (Integral to Hero Section):

At the very bottom of the Hero Section, display a row of tool or partner logos used (e.g., Figma, Framer, Webflow, NextJS).

Introductory text above the logos (e.g., "We use industry standard tools like"), using Montserrat or Poppins.

Horizontal layout, possibly with a subtle grayscale effect on logos that colorize on hover.

"Our Expertise/Services" Section (Now after Hero Section):

Display key services in an engaging grid or card format, each with a minimalist icon/illustration and a brief description. Service titles and descriptions use Montserrat or Poppins.

"Why Choose Us/Winning Edge" Section:

Highlight competitive advantages with appropriate icons or illustrations, and concise, persuasive bullet points. Text uses Montserrat or Poppins.

Photo Showcase Section (Left-Scrolling Animation - This is separate from the Hero's Project Showcase):

Include a photo showcase section displaying multiple images (this could be a gallery of behind-the-scenes, moodboards, etc., separate from the main portfolio projects).

Apply a smooth and continuous left-scrolling animation for the photo gallery.

Ensure the animation looks professional and visually appealing.

Include a hover effect that pauses or slows down the scrolling animation.

Testimonial Section:

Display client reviews in a carousel or grid format, with client profile photos (if available), name, and quotes. Text uses Montserrat or Poppins.

Final CTA:

A clear closing section with a call to action (e.g., "Ready to Launch Your Dream Project?"). Text uses Montserrat or Poppins.

Footer:

White Background: The footer background must be pure white (consistent with the overall Bone White scheme).

Minimalist with important links (About, Services, Contact, Social Media) and copyright information. Text uses Montserrat or Poppins.

B. Color Palette:
Primary Background Color (Important!): The entire website (from top to bottom) must use Bone White (#f9f6ee) as its dominant background color.

Accent: Bright, modern colors (e.g., light green, electric blue, or bright orange) for CTA buttons, icons, or text highlights.

Text: Black or dark gray for high readability.

Note: Define these colors as Custom CSS Variables within your Tailwind configuration (tailwind.config.js) for easy management across the design.

C. Typography:
Main Text Heading Font:

Choice: Instrument Serif 400.

Characteristics: A distinctive yet clean serif font, used to provide an elegant touch and focus on the most prominent main headings.

Usage: Main heading in the Hero Section (Homepage), the main heading of the Portfolio page ("Showcase of Our Best Works").

Sub-heading & Body Font (Display & Body Font):

Choice: Montserrat or Poppins.

Characteristics: Modern, clean, sans-serif, and highly readable.

Usage:

Sub-headings: For supporting sub-headings in the Hero Section (e.g., "70+ Amazing Websites Created So Far"), service/advantage titles, individual project titles on the portfolio page (e.g., "Suprema", "Prismo"), testimonial titles, and small texts like "Accepting new projects" and "We use industry standard tools like".

Body Text: For paragraphs, detailed project descriptions, captions, navigation (excluding the main headings), button text, and all longer blocks of text.

Optimization: Ensure font size, line-height, and letter-spacing are optimized for readability across all devices.

Note: Import these fonts via Google Fonts or other methods, and apply them through your Tailwind configuration.

D. Interactive Elements (Buttons, Navigation, etc.):
CTA Buttons: Pill-shaped or with subtly rounded corners.

Accent background color, white/dark text. Hover Effect: Background color change, slight enlargement, or a subtle shadow effect.

Navigation: Text color change or a subtle underline on hover/active state.

Forms: Clean input fields with thin borders, a subtle focus effect when clicked.

E. Visual Effects & Animations:
Micro-interactions: Small animations when scrolling or hovering over important elements.

Scroll Animation: Elements smoothly appear or slide-in as they are scrolled into view.

Section 2: Portfolio Page Design (Lander.studio/works)
A. Layout & General Structure:
Header: Same as the homepage, including the centered navigation and scroll-hide/show behavior.

Hero Section: A clear page title (e.g., "Showcase of Our Best Works") with a brief sub-heading. This page's main title must use Instrument Serif 400 and can incorporate an accent color for emphasis. Sub-heading uses Montserrat or Poppins.

Category Filters:

Add category filters above the project list.

Use an elegant and minimalist button design (as in the image: "Websites", "Logo & Branding").

The active (selected) button should have a prominent style (e.g., darker background or bolder text) compared to inactive ones. Filter text uses Montserrat or Poppins.

Project Detail Display:

Display each project in an individual detail block format, similar to a large card structure.

Internal Layout of Each Project:

On the left side: A prominent project image/thumbnail (possibly multiple images or device representations).

On the right side:

Project Title (using Montserrat or Poppins, slightly smaller than the page hero).

A more detailed project description (several paragraphs, using Montserrat or Poppins).

A project-specific CTA button (e.g., "Open Website", "View Case Study", or "Learn More") with a style consistent with the main CTA button.

Project Card Aesthetics: Each project block should be wrapped in a "card" with a Bone White background, rounded corners, and a soft shadow to give a sense of depth and separation.

Interactive Effects:

Subtle hover effect on the project image (e.g., slight scale-up or a blur/grayscale effect that disappears on hover).

Smooth transition on the "Open Website" button on hover.

Final CTA: Call to action to contact or explore other services. Text uses Montserrat or Poppins.

Footer: Same as the homepage, with a white background (Bone White).

B. Color Palette, Typography, Interactive Elements, and Visual Effects:
Consistent with Homepage: Maintain the same color palette, typography (according to new specifications), button styles, and visual effects as defined for the homepage to ensure brand consistency and user experience.

Ensure accent colors are used in the "Works" page hero title and active filter buttons.

Additional Considerations:
Responsiveness (Mobile-First!):

The design must be fully responsive and look perfect on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Prioritize design and styling for the smallest screens first, then use Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl) to adjust the layout for larger screens.

Ensure layout and functionality are not broken on either mobile or desktop displays.

Performance: Optimize images and assets for fast loading.

Small Details: Pay attention to details like spacing (padding/margin), subtle shadows, and corner curves to provide a premium look.

Scrollbar Color (Important!): Ensure the browser scrollbar color is white or very light, to match the Light Mode aesthetic and Bone White color. This may require custom CSS outside of Tailwind, or a suitable Tailwind plugin (e.g., tailwind-scrollbar).

Technical Specifications (for Implementation):
Use HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for implementation.

All styling must use Tailwind CSS utility classes. For custom styles or complex animations, use @apply or extend your Tailwind configuration (e.g., for scroll-hide/show navbar animation, gallery/carousel scroll keyframes, custom scrollbar styles, and wave background).

Wave Texture Implementation:

Acquire or create a clean SVG or PNG image of the wave texture.

Define it as a background-image on the Hero Section element (or an overlay div within it).

Use background-repeat: no-repeat or repeat-x as needed, and background-position.

Control its opacity using Tailwind classes like opacity-10 or opacity-20 on the image/overlay element.

Animations must be smooth (60fps) and not cause performance issues.

Include a hover effect that pauses or slows down the animation on the photo gallery.

Optimize images for web performance (WebP format recommended).

Ease of Editing (Crucial!):

content.json: Create a single content.json file that will store ALL visible UI text (headings, sub-headings, service descriptions, testimonials, button texts, etc.) and ALL image paths used in the design.

The structure of content.json must support all described elements, including data for the Project Showcase in the Hero Section (project names, images, links), "Tools Used" data (text and list of logos), enriched portfolio project details, category filters, navbar data, and the path to the wave texture image (if using a separate image file). Ensure every piece of displayed text originates from here.

JavaScript for Dynamic Content: Use JavaScript to read data from content.json and dynamically populate HTML elements. This will ensure that any changes to content.json are immediately reflected in the display without needing to edit HTML/CSS.

JavaScript for Navbar Scroll Behavior: Implement JavaScript logic to detect scroll direction and add/remove Tailwind classes that control the navbar's visibility and animation (e.g., hidden, translate-y-0, translate-y-full, opacity-0, opacity-100, transition-all duration-300).

Deliverables:

Complete HTML structure for the homepage (index.html) and portfolio page (works.html or similar).

tailwind.config.js file configured with colors (including Bone White), fonts (Instrument Serif, Montserrat/Poppins), custom utilities (including navbar and scrollbar animations), and animation keyframes.

The compiled CSS output generated by Tailwind.

A complete content.json file with all text and image paths, and a structure that supports dynamic content.

JavaScript code for smooth scrolling functionality (photo gallery and hero carousel), navbar scroll-hide/show behavior, and for loading content from content.json dynamically.

A brief explanation of how the animations (especially photo gallery, hero carousel, and navbar) work and how content.json is utilized.

Suggestions for image dimensions and file formats (including recommended aspect ratios for project images).

The wave texture image file to be used (SVG is recommended for its lightweight and scalability).

Style Guidelines:

Use a clean and modern aesthetic.

Apply appropriate spacing and typography.

Ensure good contrast and accessibility.

Include smooth transitions and micro-interactions.
